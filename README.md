# Imperial
Imperial is a simple GUI I wrote to add custom MIME types and file icons on Ubuntu. It is written in PyQt4. This was my first app using the Qt framework. I could've written it much faster in Java but I wanted to learn Qt.

Also I know it seems dumb to use a Makefile for a Python project but I also wanted to learn the make system. I call this "multitasking".

### Build and Run
Calling the run executable will automatically trigger make and then enter the application.

### Authors
- Me (Alex Lugo, the Alex of Lugo)
- That's it

### Todo
- Implement "add mimetype" functionality
- Clean up interface
- Finalize the icon/logo
